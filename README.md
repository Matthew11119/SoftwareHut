# OSCE Assessment Tool
---

### Description
The system is used for in-session recording of assessment for Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs). The users of this system are Administrators, Module Leads and Examiners. Examiners are able to record assessments in the examinations using an OSCE rubric form (consisting of values such as ‘met’, ‘partially met’, ‘not met’). The system uses the data entered to calculate the marks for student (pass/fail). The results and feedbacks (audio and written) are exported in PDF and audio format for external usage. Module Leads will assign the correct OSCE to a device, for use by an examiner in assessing a student. An Administrator has control over he system and handles management of exams and OSCE forms (create, edit, deploy, delete), assigning students to exams, dates for the exams, editing and archiving.
